Your role is to identify requirements from backlog items as a requirements engineer.
You are not allowed to rephrase or alter extracted text segments.
Identify and only return the unaltered segment from the text, without rephrasing or rewording, summarizing, or inferring any additional information.

Only extract text segments from a backlog item that fit the description of a requirement and its subcategories.
Definition of a requirement: A requirement specifies an added or modified functionality to the system or addresses a non-functional aspect such as quality attributes.
Subcategories:
- User-oriented functional requirement: Functionality experienced directly by the user.
- System-oriented functional requirement: Functionality implemented in the system that are not directly experienced by the user.
- Non-functional requirement: Specifies quality attributes such as usability, performance, or security.

Exclude:
- Documentation 
- Updates
- Feature enablement
- Rights or access 
- Tasks that have no direct impact on the system
- Suggestions
- Considerations
- Questions

List requirements as:
requirement 1: 
requirement 2:

Summary: Add support for OS detection for the pervasive red DOWNLOAD buttons
Description: h2. Requirements We need to be able to detect the user's OS for the CDK and Red Hat Development Suite products and change the primary CTA for these products on both their product-specific Download page and the site Downloads page. Refer to [OS based downloads in the Requirements Doc |https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1WljXUSM8EonxaFKtDTmysxrWUnssH1PiShKZ6Mz1o/edit?ts=59c0d31b#heading=h.i6hwqauxuh05] for full details Other Notes from Nick: So that the pervasive red "DOWNLOAD" button can link to the correct download for the user's platform, we need some kind of javascript based OS detection. Today the button just links to the FIRST available download on the download page [4], [5], regardless of OS. Then, rather than a Windows user being prompted to download the linux version of the CDK or the Developer Suite installer, they'd get the Windows-appropriate [1] one. Same story for MacOS [2]. But for Linux users, we'd need to redirect them to another page [3] to explain how to enable the software collection, import the signing key, and install via yum. [1] https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/devsuite-2.0.0-GA-installer.exe [2] https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/devsuite-2.0.0-GA-installer-mac.zip [3] https://developers.redhat.com/products/devsuite/hello-world/#fndtn-rhel See also https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-21427, where the request to add the devsuite installer binaries to the CDK downloads page is being discussed. h2.

Summary: Convert <h1> tags in archives to <h2>
Description: Following discussions with Jairus on SEO, we learned that there should be only one <h1> heading in the HTML on any given page. The archive pages â€“ categories, author page, tag pages and front page, all have multiple <h1> enclosed post titles/links. On the front page, the first post should be the only <h1> (unless a permanent title is added later). On the category, tag and author page, all post titles should be <h2>, since the pages all already have one <h1> heading.

Summary: Create sortable table component
Description: h2. Requirements [~mguerett] has requested a way to create a sortable table of data for content. We'll need to add a custom element that will be a Red Hat approved tag that can be used to denote a sortable table. h2. Design * Engineering-only (with existing styles) * [Invision Wireframes|https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/WRE1LVQT4#/259322893_Sortable_Table] h2. Stakeholders * Approval - [~mguerett] * Eng - [~ldary24] * UX Consult - [~gdoyle-1] h2. Acceptance Criteria * As a content creator I should be able to create a table that is sortable by the column headings * If I surround a table element with the <rh-sortable> tag it should automatically enable sorting the table by the column headers h3. Feature: Sortable Table h3. Scenario 1 Given I am on a page with a sortable table of data Then display two carets on top of each other And display them to the right of the column header. h3. Scenario 2 Given I am on a page with a sortable table of data When I select a column header Display a blue bar above the heading of the column And display the column header and top caret to the right of the heading in blue And sort the data from top to bottom. h3. Scenario 3 Given I have selected a column and the elements of Scenario 2 have been met When I select the same column header again Display the bottom caret to the right of the heading in blue And sort the data from bottom to top. h3. Scenario 4 Given I have selected a column and elements of Scenario 3 have been met When I select the same column header again Display the top caret to the right of the heading in blue And sort the data from top to bottom (continue this cycle if the column header is selected again). h3. Scenario 5 Given I have selected a column and the elements of Scenario 2 have been met When I select a different column header Display two carets on top of each other to the right of all column headers other than the selected one. h2. Review Steps * Create a Basic Page * Put a table element in using column headers and at least a couple rows of data * Surround the table element with the <rh-sortable> </rh-sortable> tag * Save the page and view it * The column headers should sort the data in a sensible fashion (text versus numbers).
