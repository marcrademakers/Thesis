    "Allow the administrator to define those hierarchies for RBAC, allowing a customer to see one level of the hierarchy and everything below (in contrast to defining a list of accounts)",

More specifically, when a call is made on a Glacier content item via the storeclient, a ContentStateException is thrown. (If the content item was recently added or has been retrieved from Glacier, it will simply download as expected) This task is to show the user an appropriate error message indicating that the content is in Glacier. For now, that error message can indicate that the user should contact DuraCloud support if they wish to retrieve that content item.",

This flag would tell the synctool to go through the steps of determining which files should be sync-ed up to DuraCloud (including deleted and modified content), but instead of actually performing the sync, just a report will be produced detailing which content would have been sync-ed.",
